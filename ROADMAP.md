# ROADMAP

## CNCF Ecosystem

* Deploy SuperNode using Helm in Kubernetes
* Deploy dfget & dfdaemon using DaemonSet in Kubernetes
* Integration with Harbor: preheat image feature

## Security

* Support private container image
* Support authentication in SuperNode API
* Different encryption algorithm in data transmission

## Efficiency

* Dynamic downloading rate limiting and scheduling algorithm
* Use IPFS to share block datas between SuperNodes

## Openness

* Plug-In policy for CNCF projects
* Highly user-customized modules
* Refactor SuperNode with Golang

## Scalability

* Simplify the complexity of scaling SuperNodes in Kubernetes

## Stability

* Cluster the SuperNode to decrease possibility of failure
