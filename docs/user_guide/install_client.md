## Installing from the Latest Package

You can install from the latest packages we provided.

1. Download a package of the client.

    ```bash
    cd $HOME
    # Replace ${package} with a package appropriate for your operating system and location
    wget ${package}
    ```

    Available packages:

    - If you're in China:

        - [Linux 64-bit](http://dragonfly-os.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/df-client_0.2.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz): `http://dragonfly-os.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/df-client_0.2.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz`

        - [MacOS 64-bit](http://dragonfly-os.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/df-client_0.2.0_darwin_amd64.tar.gz): `http://dragonfly-os.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/df-client_0.2.0_darwin_amd64.tar.gz`

    tar -zxf df-client_0.2.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C xxx

    # Execute or add this line to ~/.bashrc
    export PATH=$PATH:xxx/df-client/
