# Monitor Dragonfly with Prometheus

Currently, metrics become an important part of observability. As for monitoring Dragonfly, we recommend you to use Prometheus.

In the Dragonfly project, there are two long-running processes: supernode and dfdaemon. Each of the components expose its metrics via `/metrics` endpoint, so Prometheus can get metrics from each component. We will also support dfget metrics in the future. As for current metrics, you can check out [metrics](metrics.md).

## How to set up Prometheus

### Setup Dragonfly Environment

First, please ensure you know how to set up a Dragonfly environment. If you don't, you can check out this  [quick_start](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/Dragonfly/blob/master/docs/quick_start/README.md) docs first. Besides, building from source code is ok.

``` bash
make build
# start supernode and dfdaemon
bin/linux_amd64/supernode --advertise-ip 127.0.0.1
bin/linux_amd64/dfdaemon
```

When supernode and dfdaemon are running normally, you can check metrics through the command line.

check dfdaemon metrics:

``` bash
➜  ~ curl localhost:65001/metrics
# HELP go_gc_duration_seconds A summary of the GC invocation durations.
# TYPE go_gc_duration_seconds summary
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0"} 0
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.25"} 0
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 0
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.75"} 0
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="1"} 0
go_gc_duration_seconds_sum 0
go_gc_duration_seconds_count 0
# HELP go_goroutines Number of goroutines that currently exist.
# TYPE go_goroutines gauge
go_goroutines 10
```

check supernode metrics:

``` bash
➜  ~ curl localhost:8002/metrics
# HELP go_gc_duration_seconds A summary of the GC invocation durations.
# TYPE go_gc_duration_seconds summary
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0"} 2.2854e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.25"} 0.000150952
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 0.000155267
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.75"} 0.000171251
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="1"} 0.00018524
go_gc_duration_seconds_sum 0.000685564
go_gc_duration_seconds_count 5
# HELP go_goroutines Number of goroutines that currently exist.
# TYPE go_goroutines gauge
go_goroutines 8
```

If you can get the results above, it means your Dragonfly components work well. Next, we will start to setup Prometheus.

### Download Prometheus

[Download the release of Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/download/) for your platform, then extract and run it. Here we take Linux version as an example:

``` bash
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.11.1/prometheus-2.11.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf prometheus-2.11.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd prometheus-2.11.1.linux-amd64
```

Before starting using Prometheus, we should configure Prometheus first.

### Configure Prometheus

Here we provide a minimal-configuration below for monitoring Dragonfly. As for more detailed configuration, you can check [Prometheus Configuration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/) for help.

```
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
          # - alertmanager:9093

rule_files:
# - "first_rules.yml"
# - "second_rules.yml"

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'dragonfly'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8002', 'localhost:65001']
```

If you are not familiar with Prometheus, you can modify `prometheus.yml` to this configuration above. Here we don't use any alert rules and alertmanager, so these parts are unset. After modifying this file, you can validate it via `promtool`.

``` bash
./promtool check config prometheus.yml
Checking prometheus.yml
  SUCCESS: 0 rule files found
```

Finally, you can start Prometheus in the same directory. If Prometheus works well, you can open your browser with localhost:9090 and see Prometheus web UI.

``` bash
./prometheus
```

### Get Dragonfly Metrics Using Prometheus

In Prometheus web UI, you can search Dragonfly metrics below. If you want to learn more about Prometheus query language, please check [promql](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) for help.
