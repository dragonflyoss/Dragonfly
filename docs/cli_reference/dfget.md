## dfget

client of Dragonfly used to download and upload files

### Synopsis

dfget is the client of Dragonfly which takes a role of peer in a P2P network.
When user triggers a file downloading task, dfget will download the pieces of
file from other peers. Meanwhile, it will act as an uploader to support other
peers to download pieces from it if it owns them. In addition, dfget has the
abilities to provide more advanced functionality, such as network bandwidth
limit, transmission encryption and so on.
