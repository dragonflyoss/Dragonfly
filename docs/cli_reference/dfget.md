## dfget

client of Dragonfly used to download and upload files

### Synopsis

dfget is the client of Dragonfly which takes a role of peer in a P2P network.
When user triggers a file downloading task, dfget will download the pieces of
file from other peers. Meanwhile, it will act as an uploader to support other
peers to download pieces from it if it owns them. In addition, dfget has the
abilities to provide more advanced functionality, such as network bandwidth
limit, transmission encryption and so on.

### Options

```
      --alivetime duration    alive duration for which uploader keeps no accessing by any uploading requests, after this period uploader will automatically exit (default 5m0s)
      --cacerts strings       the cacert file which is used to verify remote server when supernode interact with the source.
      --callsystem string     the name of dfget caller which is for debugging. Once set, it will be passed to all components around the request to make debugging easy
      --clientqueue int       specify the size of client queue which controls the number of pieces that can be processed simultaneously (default 6)
      --console               show log on console, it's conflict with '--showbar'
      --dfdaemon              identify whether the request is from dfdaemon
      --expiretime duration   caching duration for which cached file keeps no accessed by any process, after this period cache file will be deleted (default 3m0s)
  -f, --filter string         filter some query params of URL, use char '&' to separate different params
                              eg: -f 'key&sign' will filter 'key' and 'sign' query param

      --home string           the work home directory of dfget
  -i, --identifier string     the usage of identifier is making different downloading tasks generate different downloading task IDs even if they have the same URLs. conflict with --md5.

      --ip string             IP address that server will listen on
  -s, --locallimit rate       network bandwidth rate limit for single download task, in format of G(B)/g/M(B)/m/K(B)/k/B, pure number will also be parsed as Byte (default 0B)
  -m, --md5 string            md5 value input from user for the requested downloading file to enhance security
      --minrate rate          minimal network bandwidth rate for downloading a file, in format of G(B)/g/M(B)/m/K(B)/k/B, pure number will also be parsed as Byte (default 0B)
  -n, --node supernodes       specify the addresses(host:port=weight) of supernodes where the host is necessary, the port(default: 8002) and the weight(default:1) are optional. And the type of weight must be integer
      --notbs                 disable back source downloading for requested file when p2p fails to download it
  -o, --output string         destination path which is used to store the requested downloading file. It must contain detailed directory and specific filename, for example, '/tmp/file.mp4'
  -p, --pattern string        download pattern, must be p2p/cdn/source, cdn and source do not support flag --totallimit (default "p2p")
