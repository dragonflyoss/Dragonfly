## supernode

the central control server of Dragonfly used for scheduling and cdn cache

### Synopsis

SuperNode is a long-running process with two primary responsibilities:
It's the tracker and scheduler in the P2P network that choose appropriate downloading net-path for each peer.
It's also a CDN server that caches downloaded data from source to avoid downloading the same files from source repeatedly.
