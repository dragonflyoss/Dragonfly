          The initial status of a created preheat task is WAITING.
          It's finished when a preheat task's status is FAILED or SUCCESS.
          A finished preheat task's information can be queried within 24 hours.

          The size of pieces which is calculated as per the following strategy
          1. If file's total size is less than 200MB, then the piece size is 4MB by default.
          2. Otherwise, it equals to the smaller value between totalSize/100MB + 2 MB and 15MB.

      cID:
        type: "string"
        description: |
          CID means the client ID. It maps to the specific dfget process. 
          When user wishes to download an image/file, user would start a dfget process to do this. 
          This dfget is treated a client and carries a client ID. 
          Thus, multiple dfget processes on the same peer have different CIDs.
      path:
        type: "string"
        description: |
          path is used in one peer A for uploading functionality. When peer B hopes
          to get piece C from peer A, B must provide a URL for piece C.
          Then when creating a task in supernode, peer A must provide this URL in request.

      peerID:
        type: "string"
        description: |
          PeerID uniquely identifies a peer, and the cID uniquely identifies a 
          download task belonging to a peer. One peer can initiate multiple download tasks, 
          which means that one peer corresponds to multiple cIDs.
